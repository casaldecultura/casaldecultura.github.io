## This website is a work-in-progress
As such, there are a few incomplete features:
- Artwork is still mostly black and white, uncoloured
- Picture gallery plugin is a little bit buggy, scrolling to top of page while viewing, and does not interact well with the navbar
- No dark mode wallpaper setup
- Calendar of events is empty. It could also be linked to a Google Calendar backend through a CORS proxy.
- Website theme and content needs adapting for multilingual. Currently Castillian Spanish, requires content in English/German/Catalan/French as a minimum, and a switch between different translations for the navbar
- Content needs polishing, verifying details including commercial status
- Is a blog needed? It can be added, but may require some website redesign
- Backend: Migrate to page bundles? May facilitate image resource management
	- This would require adaptations to the picture gallery plugin
	- Consider using Hugo resources for images, too
- Photo captions are in English; possibly more difficult to translate due to **Hugo Easy Gallery** plugin
- More info needed **About Us**; webmaster lacks information
- Dedicated **Tourism** page with user reviews etc? Currently located on **About Us**
